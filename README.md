# Elm Advanced Grid

## Please use Orange-Opensource/elm-advanced-grid instead of this module.


This library displays a dynamically configurable grid of data.

It offers in-place filtering and  sorting, multiple selection, click event listener and
customizable rendering of the rows and cells.
Columns can be resized using the mouse. They can also be reordered by drag and drop. 
 
The data can count more than 20,000 lines, with a limited performance impact, thanks to the use of [FabienHenon/elm-infinite-list-view](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/FabienHenon/elm-infinite-list-view/latest/) under the hood.

[Demos](https://orange-opensource.github.io/elm-advanced-grid/) are available.
 
See the src/Examples directory content for the source code of the examples.
