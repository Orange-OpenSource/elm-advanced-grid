# Elm Advanced Grid

This library displays a grid of data.
It offers in-place filtering and  sorting, multiple selection, click event listener and
customizable rendering of the rows and cells.
Columns can be resized using the mouse. They also may be reorderd by drag and drag.
 
The list of data can be very long, thanks to the use of [FabienHenon/elm-infinite-list-view](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/FabienHenon/elm-infinite-list-view/latest/) under the hood.
